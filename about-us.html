            <p style="background: cadetblue;">I graduated from Anadolu University, Department of Civil Engineering. In 2018, I studied at the Department of Civil Engineering, Halmstad University, Sweden with a 6-months Erasmus program. I completed my Master’s Degree in the field of Occupational Health and Safety. I am a civil engineer who is strong in human relations and likes to work planned. Who always wants to improve himself. I have learned the current programs required by my profession from various institutions and received certificates.  <br>
